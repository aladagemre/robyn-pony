# Robyn-Pony

A high-performance, low-latency web application skeleton built with [Robyn](https://robyn.tech/) and [Pony ORM](https://ponyorm.org/). This project is designed for building resource-efficient, highly scalable web applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **Ultra-Fast Performance**: Built on Robyn, a rust-based Python web framework
- **Efficient ORM**: Pony ORM for intuitive and performant database operations
- **Low Resource Footprint**: Optimized for environments with limited resources
- **High Scalability**: Designed for handling high concurrent loads
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Python type hints and Pony ORM's type system

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **[Robyn](https://robyn.tech/)**: High-performance async web framework written in Rust
- **[Pony ORM](https://ponyorm.org/)**: Python ORM with generator-based query execution
- **Python 3.8+**: Modern Python features and type hints
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Database support through Pony ORM

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- A compatible database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aladagemre/robyn-pony.git
   cd robyn-pony
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## 🔍 Key Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: Optimized for low latency and minimal resource usage
2. **Type Safety**: Strict typing for better code reliability
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns for maintainability
4. **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep the stack lean and efficient

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- Robyn's Rust-based core for maximum performance
- Pony ORM's efficient query generation and execution
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Minimal middleware overhead
- Optimized routing system

## 🧪 Testing
